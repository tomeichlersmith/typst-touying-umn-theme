# UMN Theme for Typst/Touying

[Touying](https://touying-typ.github.io/) is a slide-creating package for
[Typst](https://typst.app/docs).

This theme is a slight simplification of the "university" theme shipped with Touying
that uses the UMN colors by default.

There are no versions and there is no package.
Copy the [umn-theme.typ](umn-theme.typ) file into your work area if you want to try using it.
